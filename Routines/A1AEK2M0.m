 ; A few random notes on various KIDS issues
 ; If the original is a mail message, it will looks like this

 ; >> Extracted from mail message
 ; >> **KIDS**:GMRA*4.0*44^
 ; >> 
 ; >> **INSTALL NAME** etc..
 ; >> kids contents
 ; >> **END**
 ; >> **END**
 ;
 ; If the original isn't a PM HFS-extracted KIDS build, but a Straight from 
 ; KIDS KIDS-build, then the KIDS first line looks like this:
 ;
 ; >> KIDS Distribution saved on Apr 30, 2013@05:31:47
 ; >> OR*371
 ; >> **KIDS**:OR*3.0*371^
 ; >> <blank line>
 ; >> **INSTALL NAME**
 ;
 ; Multibuilds look like this:

 ; >> KIDS Distribution saved on Sep 23, 2011@17:42:57
 ; >> IB/PRCA Remedy Ticket Fixes
 ; >> **KIDS**:IB*2.0*459^PRCA*4.5*280^
